# QueueUp Player (iOS) - [queueup.io](http://queueup.io)

Let your party decide what to play; no more switching the aux cable!

Host a playlist and let your friends add songs and vote on what they want to hear next - or add songs to a playlist that a friend is hosting. All using Spotify's extensive music catalog. Hosting requires a Spotify Premium account.
